# Seasonal functioning 
Data and R code to model and analyse the seasonal functioning of the pelagic food web of the Sylt-Rømø Bight, Northern Wadden Sea, Germany. 
This work is part of a Master thesis in progress.

Description:We assessed the seasonal functioning of the pelagic food web of the Sylt-Rømø Bight, a tidal basin of the Northern Wadden Sea, 
across spring (Mar.-May), summer (Jun.-Aug.) and autumn (Sept.-Nov.) of the years 2009 and 2010. These years substantially differed in their 
seasonal plankton population dynamics and these pronounced interannual differences were associated to the ice cold winter event of 2009/2010 
that interrupted a series of preceding mild winters. In doing so, this study is the first (1) to describe in detail the pelagic food web of 
the Sylt-Rømø Bight tidal basin, (2) to explore the seasonality of its structural and functional properties, and (3) to analyse its potential 
vulnerability to warming winter climate. 

To do so, we assembled data on species seasonal standing stocks from monitoring databases and gathered information on species´ energetics and 
food spectra from literature to construct six ecological networks (i.e. food web models) that captured the carbon flow (in mg C/m³/day) between 
pelagic functional groups or species and carbon exchanges with their non-living environment across seasons. These networks comprised 16 living 
carbon pools (i.e. compartments) that integrated the main autotrophic (diatoms, Phaeocystis sp.) and heterotrophic (bacteria, ciliates, meroplankton, 
mesozooplankton, jellyfish, herring) functional groups or species of the pelagic zone, as well as two detrital compartments (POC, DOC). 

To quantify the carbon flows we used a linear inverse modelling approach in combination with a Monte Carlo sampling technique (i.e. LIM-MCMC) that 
allowed us to account for the large uncertainties associated with the species´ diets and energetics. Hence, the carbon flows of the seasonal food web 
models comprised 6000-7000 values each and flows were defined by the upper and lower boundary of the value distribution. 

We then used ecological network 
analysis (i.e. ENA) routines to describe the seasonal properties of the pelagic food web on the basis of ENA information indices. These indices characterized the (1) size and activity, (2) the efficiency of trophic transfer, (3) the connectivity and complexity, (4) the recycling of carbon via detritivore pathways, and (5) the flow organization of the seasonal food web.

We asked three questions to describe the pelagic food web and analyse its response to seasonal forcing and contrasting environmental disturbance 
(i.e. mild vs. ice cold winter):

(1)What are the structural and functional properties of the pelagic food web of the Sylt-Rømø Bight?

(2)Do these properties display seasonal patterns that recur on a yearly basis? 

(3)Did the winter climate constitute a (potential) stress factor for the food web´s functioning of the following year?
